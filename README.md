# The Speech-Language Resource Repository

<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>An application that filters through a database of speech therapy resources around the web. The database was built with Firebase. Features custom "filter chips" that behave like checkboxes to search through multiple categories at once. Also a search function that highlights keywords found in titles and descriptions of resource objects. Handy!</p>
